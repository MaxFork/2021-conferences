A list of [2020 conferences](https://github.com/ryanburgess/2020-conferences).

_**You can also add all conferences directly into your calendar by importing the `.ics` file into Google Calendar etc.**_

_**The `.ics` file can be downloaded [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ryanburgess/2021-conferences@main/2021-conferences.ics), but it's recommended to add it via URL (if your client supports that). Thus, you will dynamically get all updates.**_
